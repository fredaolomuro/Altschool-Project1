    <p style="font-weight: bold">About me:</p>
    <p>
      My name is Olomuro Freda Roli, a 400 level student of Obafemi Awolowo
      University. I hail from Delta State, Nigeria. I am a student of History
      and International Relations. But, apart from school I am a social
      butterfly. I love interacting and sharing ideas with people from different
      spheres of life. Also, I really love cooking and baking and I do it for
      business sometimes. Currently, I am a student in Altschool in the Frontend
      track. I am quite passionate about tech and I would really love to create
      awareness for people to be enlightened in the world of technology.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Why Altschool:</p>
    <p>
      I really can't say that I have always been a lover of tech, I didn't even
      understand what it entailed. I got enlightened exactly around this time
      last year and I was really intrigued to know more and learn more about it.
      I started with my personal research and a good friend recommended
      Altschool to me. Definitely, I did not jump at the decision at first. I
      made my research on the school and i was amazed. This was exactly what I
      needed. I had zero knowledge about tech and Altschool teaches people right
      from scratch. i am over two months in this journey and I am loving every
      bit of it. Did I mention, I have met wonderful mates that are now turned
      friends and tutors that makes the journey easier for me here at Altschool.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">My Goals and Aspiration</p>
    <p>
      All i anticipate throughout this journey is growth, transformation and
      consistency. And at the end of my program here at Altschool, I want to be
      well equipped and I want to gain all the knowledge I can. Definitely,
      learning never ends and I hope to continue and sharpen what I have learnt
      here. I want to be able to solve problemns in every sphere of influence
      and to be able to create bautiful websites for tech companies. With my
      learning and knowledge, I know that one day I will be able to create my
      own tech startup that connects tech with different food businesses.
